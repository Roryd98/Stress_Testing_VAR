# Stress_Testing_VAR
Python code to sort raw data based on specified dates to find the worst 1 day, maximum drawdown and full period return.
This code assumed raw data coming from an xls file which has accurate dates. I reccommend downloaing data from Bloomberg or similiar.

## Libraries needed
Pandas, numpy, and os. I pyton.display and datetime are also used by can be replaced by similar supporting libraries.

## Code Overview
When loading the excel file through the file path, ensure the location is entered as is and from an excel file. One the 3rd chunk, the dates can be adjusted and is defined as "periods". The remainder should be intuitive with assist from comments. Contact me through github or find my email address to reach out regarding any queries.
